# ThriveVR

Thrive seeks to add a fun twist to the traditions of physical therapy. Looking ahead at emerging technologies we see a great opportunity to help patients in new & innovative ways in AR/VR. The applications for Parkinsons and stroke treatment through virtual play. The key idea is that we can engage patients for longer productive sessions. Whether their struggles be through pain or exhaustion the fun will always be a great motivator.
